# Discussion

This section contains discussion pieces for the various aspects of scholarly web annotation.

- [Handling permissions](handling-permissions.md): scholars want control over who has access to their annotations. Some annotations should remain private and only accessible to their creator, some should be shared with collaborators and some should be public, so that they can be referenced in publication or reused by others.
- [Handling resource structure](handling_resource_structure.md): (**old**)
